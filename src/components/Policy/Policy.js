          OUR USE OF COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING MECHANISMS
        </h5>
        <p className="policy__text">
          We and our third-party service providers use cookies and other
          tracking mechanisms (including tracking technologies designed for
          mobile applications) to track information about your use of our App
          and Services. We may combine this information with other personal
          information we collect from you (and our third-party service providers
          may do so on our behalf).
          <br />
          Cookies - Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to
          your computer’s hard drive through your web browser for record-keeping
          purposes. Some cookies allow us to make it easier for you to navigate
          our App and Services, while others are used to enable a faster log-in
          process or to allow us to track your activities at our App and
          Service. There are four types of cookie:
          <br />
          -Strictly necessary cookies - These are cookies that are required for
          the operation of our App. They include, for example, cookies that
          enable users to log into secure areas of our App.
          <br />
          -Analytical/performance cookies - These types of cookies allow us to
          recognize, count the number of visitors, and see how visitors move
          around our App when they are using it. This assists us to improve the
          way in which our App works, for example, by ensuring that you can find
          what you are looking for easily.
          <br />
          -Functionality cookies - These cookies are used to recognize you when
          you return to our App. They enable the personalization of content,
          recognition of users, and also remember your user preferences (for
          example, your choice of language or region).
          <br />
          -Targeting cookies - These cookies record your visit to our App, the
          individual pages visited and the links followed. If the cookie is set
          by a third party (for example, an advertising network) which also
          monitors traffic on other websites, this type of cookie may also be
          used to track your movements across different websites and to create
          profiles of your general online behavior. Information collected by
          tracking cookies is commonly used to target online advertising.
          <br />
          The four types of cookies above will be either session cookies or
          persistent cookies.
          <br />
          -Session Cookies - Session cookies exist only during an online
          session. They disappear from your computer when you close your browser
          or turn off your computer. We use session cookies to allow our systems
          to uniquely identify you during a session or while you are logged into
          the App or Services. This allows us to process your online
          transactions and requests and verify your identity, after you have
          logged in, as you move through our App or Services.
          <br />
          -Persistent Cookies - Persistent cookies remain on your computer after
          you have closed your browser or turned off your computer. We use
          persistent cookies to remember your user information, preferences and
          activity, to enable us to provide our services to you when you next
          return to our App or Services. We also use persistent cookies to track
          aggregate and statistical information about user activity, which may
          be combined with other user information.
          <br />
          Local Storage Objects - We may use Flash Local Storage Objects (“Flash
          LSOs”) to store your App preferences and to personalize your visit.
          Flash LSOs are different from browser cookie because of the amount and
          type of data stored. Typically, you cannot control, delete, or disable
          the acceptance of Flash LSOs through your web browser. For more
          information on Flash LSOs, or to learn how to manage your settings for
          Flash LSOs, go to the Adobe Flash Player Help Page, choose “Global
          Storage Settings Panel” and follow the instructions. To see the Flash
          LSOs currently on your computer, choose “App Storage Settings Panel”
          and follow the instructions to review and, if you choose, to delete
          any specific Flash LSO.
          <br />
          Storage HTML5 Storage - We may also store your user information and
          App preferences locally within your web browser via HTML5. Clear GIFs,
          pixel tags and other technologies - Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with
          a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. In contrast to
          cookies, which are stored on your computer’s hard drive, clear GIFs
          are embedded invisibly on web pages. We may use clear GIFs (a.k.a. web
          beacons, web bugs or pixel tags), in connection with our App or
          Services to, among other things, track the activities of App visitors,
          help us manage content, and compile statistics about App and Services
          usage. We and our third-party service providers also use clear GIFs in
          HTML emails to our customers, to help us track email response rates,
          identify when our emails are viewed, and track whether our emails are
          forwarded.
          <br />
          Changing or Disabling your Cookie Settings - Most web browsers
          automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer you can edit your
          browser options to block them in the future. The Help portion of the
          toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer
          from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when
          you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether.
          Visitors to our App who disable their web browsers’ ability to accept
          cookies will be able to browse the App; however, most site features
          will not function if you disable cookies and you will not be able to
          login to use our services.
          <br />
          Do Not Track - Currently, our systems do not honor browser
          “do-not-track” requests. You may, however, disable certain tracking as
          discussed above (e.g., by disabling Cookies); you also may opt-out of
          Third Party Analytics or targeted advertising by following the
          instructions in the Third Party Ad Networks section below.
        </p>
        <h5 className="policy__subtitle">THIRD PARTY ANALYTICS</h5>
        <p className="policy__text">
          We use automated devices and applications, such as Google Analytics,
          VWO and Trendemon, to evaluate use of our App and the Services. You
          may opt-out of any of these services directly. Please note that if you
          use a new or different computer, install a new browser, or clear your
          cookies; in that case, you will need to re-opt-out through the link
          above.
        </p>
        <p className="policy__text">
          We use these tools to help us improve our Services, performance and
          user experiences. These entities may use cookies and other tracking
          technologies to perform their services. These third parties may
          collect your device ID, IP address, or other information about your
          use of the Services as part of the analytics they provide to us.
        </p>
        <h5 className="policy__subtitle">THIRD-PARTY AD NETWORKS</h5>
        <p className="policy__text">
          We use third parties, such as network advertisers and other marketing
          agents, to display advertisements on our App, to assist us in
          displaying advertisements on third party websites, and to evaluate the
          success of our advertising campaigns. Network advertisers are third
          parties that display advertisements based on your visits to our App
          and unrelated third-party websites. This enables us and these third
          parties to target advertisements by displaying ads for products and
          services in which you might be interested. Third-party ad network
          providers, advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement services
          may use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), Flash
          LSOs and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads
          and to personalize advertising content to you. These third-party
          cookies and other technologies are governed by each third party’s
          specific privacy policy, not this one. We may provide these
          third-party advertisers with information about your use of our App and
          our Services, as well as aggregate or non-personally identifiable
          information about visitors to our App and users of our Service.
          <br />
          You may opt-out of many third-party ad networks, including those
          operated by members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) and
          the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”). Opting out of one or more
          NAI member or DAA member networks (many of which will be the same)
          only means that those members no longer will deliver targeted content
          or ads to you. It does not mean you will no longer receive any
          targeted content or ads on our App or other websites. You may continue
          to receive advertisements, for example, based on the particular
          website that you are viewing. Also, if your browsers are configured to
          reject cookies when you visit this opt-out page, or you subsequently
          erase your cookies, use a different computer or mobile device or
          change web browsers, your NAI or DAA opt-out may no longer be
          effective. Additional information is available on NAI’s and DAA’s
          websites accessible by the above links.

          oblige a data processor to only process in accordance with our
          instructions; and having monitoring, reporting and resolution
          procedures in place with regard to ongoing security.
          <br />

          We process your information based on the following legal grounds, as
          recognized by and in compliance with the applicable data protection
          laws: the processing is necessary to perform our contract with you
          (i.e. the Terms and Conditions that apply as applicable with respect
          to Harmony Pay Services, for the provision of our Services), or to
          take steps requested by you before entering into said contract; the
          processing is in Harmony Pay’s or someone else’s legitimate interests,
          and these interests are not overridden by your interests or rights in
          the protection of your personal data. This may include processing your
          data for prevention of fraudulent activity, internal research and
          analytics assessments, for purposes of communication with you, and
          informing you about new products and services we are offering or to
          promote new products and services of other parties which we think may
          be of interest to you, etc.; you have given your consent to the
          processing of your data; the processing is necessary to meet a legal
          obligation which applies to Harmony Pay.

          Sometimes we process data about you which the law considers to fall
          within special categories (see section “What data do we process about
          you?” for more details), in which case, we use one of the following
          grounds: the processing is necessary for the establishment, exercise
          or defense of legal claims; you have freely given your informed,
          specific consent to the processing; or the processing is necessary for
          reasons of substantial public interest, based on applicable law.

          process your information, or about the legitimate interests referred

          In cases where we have asked for, and you have given, your consent to

          payments from you. In other cases, you have a choice over whether we
          collect your personal data, for example, you can turn off cookies on

          EEA CUSTOMERS ONLY: YOUR RIGHTS UNDER GDPR
        </h5>
        <p className="policy__text">
          You have several rights in relation to your personal data which are
          described in more detail below. You can exercise your rights at any
          time by contacting us at team@harmonypayment.com.
          <br />
          Accessing your data - You can ask us to: Confirm whether we are
          processing your personal data; give you a copy of that data; provide
          you with other information about your personal data such as what data
          we have, what we use it for, who we disclose it to, whether we
          transfer it abroad and how we protect it, how long we keep it for,
          what rights you have, how you can make a complaint, where we got your
          data from and whether we carry out any automated decision making or
          profiling. We aim to give you all this information in this privacy
          policy, although if anything is unclear, please contact our Data
          Protection Officer at team@harmonypay.com.
          <br />
          You do not have to pay a fee for a copy of your information unless
          your request is unfounded, respective or excessive, in which case we
          will charge a reasonable amount in the circumstances. We will let you
          know of any charges before completing your request.
          <br />
          We aim to respond to you within one (1) month of receiving your
          request unless it is particularly complicated or you have made several
          requests, in which case we aim to respond within three (3) months. We
          will let you know if we are going to take longer than one (1) month in
          dealing with your request. If we have a lot of information about you
          we might ask you if you can tell us what exactly you want to receive.
          This will help us action your request more quickly.
          <br />
          Correcting your data - You can ask us to correct any data which is
          inaccurate or incomplete. This is free of charge. If we have shared
          the data with anyone else, we will tell them about the correction
          wherever possible. We aim to deal with requests for correction within
          one (1) month, although it might take us up to three (3) months if
          your request is particularly complicated. If we cannot action a
          request to correct your data, we will let you know and explain why
          this is.
          <br />
          Erasing your data - This is not an absolute right but you have the
          right to have your data erased, free of charge, in certain
          circumstances. You can ask for your data to be erased where: it is no
          longer necessary for the purpose for which it was originally collected
          or processed; we are processing your data based on your consent, and
          you withdraw that consent; you object to the processing and we do not
          have an overriding legitimate interest for continuing; your data has
          been unlawfully processed; your data must be erased to comply with a
          legal obligation; the data was processed to offer information society
          services to a child. There are some exceptions to this right. If one
          of these applies, we do not have to delete the data. If we have shared
          your data with third parties, we will tell them about the erasure of
          your data unless this is impossible or would involve disproportionate
          effort.
          <br />
          Restricting the processing of your data- You can ask us to restrict
          the processing of your personal data in some circumstances, free of
          charge. This is not an absolute right. If processing is restricted we
          can store the data and retain enough information to make sure the
          restriction is respected, but we cannot further process your data. You
          can restrict the processing of your personal data in the following
          cases: if you contest the accuracy of your data, we will restrict
          processing until we have made sure the data is accurate; if you object
          to our processing and we are considering this objection; if the
          processing is unlawful but you do not want us to erase your data; if
          we no longer need the personal data but you require the data to
          establish, exercise or defend a legal claim.
          <br />
          If we have disclosed the data to a third party, we will inform them
          about the restriction unless it is impossible or would require a
          disproportionate effort. We will tell you if we decide to lift a
          restriction on processing your data.
          <br />
          Objecting to the processing of your data - Objecting to the processing
          of your data is free of charge. It is not an absolute right but you
          can object to our processing of your data where it is: based on the
          legitimate interests ground; or for the purposes of
          scientific/historical research and statistics. We will stop processing
          your personal data unless we have compelling legitimate grounds for
          the processing which override your interests and rights, or unless we
          are processing the data for the establishment, exercise or defense of
          legal claims. You can require us to stop using your data for direct
          marketing purposes. We will stop as soon as we receive your request.
          There are no exemptions or reasons for us to refuse.
          <br />
          Data Portability - This allows you to obtain and reuse your personal
          data for your own purposes across different services. It applies where
          the following conditions are met: you provided the personal data to us
          yourself; we are processing the data either based on your consent or
          because it is necessary for the performance of a contract; and the
          processing is carried out by automated means.
          <br />
          We will provide your data free of charge in a structured, commonly
          used and machine-readable form. We aim to provide your data within one
          (1) month of receiving your request unless it is particularly
          complicated or you have made several requests, in which case we aim to
          respond within three (3) months. If we are going to take longer than
          one (1) month we will let you know and explain why we need more time.
          If we consider that we cannot provide you with your data, we will
          contact you and explain why this is.
          <br />
          Automated decision making and profiling- You have the right not to be
          subject to a decision which is based on automated processing and which
          produces a legal (or similarly significant) effect on you. We will
          tell you about any automated decision making that affects you. You
          have the right to: request human intervention; express your point of
          view; ask for the decision to be explained; and challenge the
          decision.
          <br />
          These rights are not absolute. They do not apply if the decision is:
          necessary for us to enter into or perform a contract with you;
          authorized by law (e.g. for fraud prevention); or based on your
          explicit consent.
